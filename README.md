# use-fs-access

> 🗂️ React hook library that builds on top of the File System Access API, offering a clean and simple way to interact with the user's local file system from within a React application.

Designed with flexibility and usability in mind, this hook enables React developers to easily open directories, read and write files, create or delete files and directories, and build powerful file-based workflows directly in the browser — all without leaving the comfort of React's ecosystem.

Additional advanced features include lazy-loading directory structures, file watching with a polling mechanism, and batch file processing. The library also supports persisting access to previously opened directories via built-in IndexedDB storage, and offers customizable file and directory filtering (with default filters for node_modules, .git, and dist). These features make it ideal for a variety of use cases, including file managers, code editors, offline-first applications, and any other app that requires seamless local file access.

> ⚠️ Please note that the **File System Access API** is **not supported in all browsers**. It is currently supported in modern Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge) and a few others. Be sure to check [the compatibility table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API#browser_compatibility) for the most up-to-date information on supported browsers.
